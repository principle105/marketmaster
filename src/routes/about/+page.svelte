                Market Master is a fun, interactive platform to educate the
                public on financial literacy. Regardless of one's interests and
                fields of study, proficiency in money management and business
                acumen are indispensable and necessary life skills. Our stock
                market simulation provides users with the opportunity to deeply
                engage in the realms of economics and investing, honing their

                We firmly believe that education should be a universal right
                rather than a privilege. Our easily accessible, user-friendly
                simulation provides an ideal platform for beginners and expert
                economists alike to explore how world events shape our society
                and the macroeconomy. We hope that our stock market simulation
                can teach users to make informed financial decisions when
                managing their personal portfolios or even household finances.
